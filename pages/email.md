# Email address

The email address was and remains the most common identifier for an account in the Internet.
You may not have a phone number, but you must have a mailbox - this is an unwritten rule.

The email that you have reveals some information about you in itself. First of all, this is **alias**, the name of the mailbox, from the address start to the symbol @.
The first and most obvious advice is not to choose your initials, surname and date of birth as an alias, unless it is a purely personal
or work mailbox.

The second, but important tip is to carefully study the email provider. The most well-known free mail services in pursuit of email give
you accounts in other products. This is especially true of Google and Yandex, as these companies conduct their business in a large number of other areas, and they provide you a free box with a dozen other services, where you will become passive consumer and the source of personal information.
