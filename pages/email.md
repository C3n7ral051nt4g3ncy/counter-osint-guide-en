# Email address

An email address was, and still is, the most common identifier for an account on the Internet. You may not have a phone number, but you should have an email account - it's an unwritten rule.

Having an email in itself reveals some information about you. First, it's the alias, the email account's name, to the left of the '@' symbol. The first and most obvious piece of advice is not to give your initials, last name and year of birth unless it is a strictly personal or business box.

The second, but not the least, important piece of advice is to look carefully at your email provider. Most well-known free email services will give you accounts in other products on top of the email. This is especially true of Google and Yandex because they do business in so many other areas. They provide you with a free box in exchange for your personal data, and being a passive consumer of a dozen other services is their bread and butter.

## Get rid of emails for subscriptions, garbage and spam

Separately, it is worth noting the habit of many people using a separate 'junk' mailbox for non-critical services and a variety of spam subscriptions. Separating mailboxes is helpful in itself, but only if it is conscious (see above).

If you don't check it, and thousands of messages are sitting there unread, or even more, that's an important signal: make sure you really need that drawer. If not, unsubscribe from all newsletters and delete the associated accounts to minimise the likelihood of this email address being used to collect information about you.

## Disposable mailboxes

There are a large number of services that provide one-time mailboxes for 10-15 minutes. They are suitable for one-time registrations on sites you go to for the first time and are unlikely to use again. Let's look at those services set up on random domains with entirely random names.

Examples of such services are:
- [TemporaryMail](https://temporarymail.com/)
- [10minutemail](https://10minutemail.net)
- [TEMPMAIL](https://temp-mail.org/ru/)
- [Mohmal](https://www.mohmal.com/en)

## Public mailboxes

You can also find services on the Internet that allow you to use an alias for a temporary mailbox. Such email addresses are helpful for services where the email has to look plausible.

Examples of such services are:

- [Maildrop](https://maildrop.cc/)
- [Mailsac](https://mailsac.com/)
- [templail+](https://tempmail.plus)
- [Yopmail](https://yopmail.com/) - It can also support forwarding (see below)

## Forwarding emails from external mailboxes

We can use services that allow you to forward emails external masked mailboxes that hide your real address.

The principle of operation is very simple:
- Masked "external" mailbox receives the letter
- From address of this mailbox, a letter is being forwarded to your real mailbox

Firefox Relay example:

First, a mask is provided that hides the real email address.

Now, using this mask address, we can receive emails to our mailbox without showing its address to the entire Internet.

Examples of such services are:

- [SimpleLogin](https://simplelogin.io/)
- [AnonAddy]()https://anonaddy.com/ - generates addresses according to a template `*@ivanov.anonaddy.com`
- [Firefox Relay](https://relay.firefox.com/) - generates random addresses on the domain `mozmail.com`
- [erine.email](https://erine.email/) - makes addresses according to a template `*.ivanov@erine.email`
