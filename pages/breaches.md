## Passport data

⚠️ Carefully approach the choice of places when making SIM cards. The less prestigious it is, the more likely it is to leak passport scans from it, which are necessary when registering a number. Choose official salons of operators; places where the maximum number of services is provided for both individuals and legal entities.

## Known big leaks

In February 2022, the Yandex delivery database was leaked.Food (https://habr.com/ru/news/t/654039/).
The names and surnames of the clients, telephone numbers,
the full delivery address of the client and comments on the order were published.
There are almost 7 million unique numbers from Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, dates from 06/19/2021 to 02/04/2022.

To check their data, enthusiasts have raised the service https://saverudata.info/.

## How do I remove myself from leaks?

**Nothing.** You can ask popular services to [remove your record](./deleteme.md#delete-information-about-leaks),
but you won't do anything with a huge number of copies of databases that have already been sold to private and closed services.
