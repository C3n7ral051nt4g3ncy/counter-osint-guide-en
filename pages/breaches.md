## Passport details

⚠️ Choose your SIM card reseller carefully. The less prestigious it is, the more likely the passport scans required for number registration will be leaked. Choose official operator shops and places that provide the maximum number of services for both individuals and legal entities.

## Known major leaks

In February 2022, [the Yandex.Food delivery database was leaked](https://habr.com/ru/news/t/654039/).
The names and surnames of customers, phone numbers, complete customer delivery address and comments on the order were published online.
The leak contains almost 7 million unique numbers from Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, dating from 19.06.2021 to 04.02.2022.

A service https://saverudata.info/ was shared online by enthusiasts to check their data.

## How do I remove myself from the leaks?

**You can't.** You can ask popular services to [remove your record](./deleteme.md), but there is nothing you can do with the massive number of copies of the databases that have already been dispersed amongst hands, private and closed services.
