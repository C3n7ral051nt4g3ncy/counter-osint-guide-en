## How to prevent leaks

- Do not publish photos in a raw format, as a files. They often contain metadata information about the photo location.
- If you use delivery service, specify the minimum required amount of information in the standard address fields.
The most preferable option is to specify only the house number and meet the courier outside.
Also you may have ability to write secondary info (floor / apartment / intercom code) in the additional information field — the courier will easily read it, but such unstructured information is less likely to get into the database with your address.
