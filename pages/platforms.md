# Privacy of social networks and messengers

This section contains descriptions of privacy settings for all popular sites and platforms
in the CIS.

I remind you that this guide is aimed at **hiding** your information from prying eyes on the Web.
Unfortunately, almost everything you write in social networks and messengers is available to the platforms themselves.
That is, a large number of employees of this company, law enforcement and other agencies that have
the right to request this information, as well as sometimes a large number of other persons who semi
-legally support the site's activities.

To fully protect yourself from the leakage of your personal information is not to use any platforms
that do not guarantee end-to-end encryption and absolute security of your data, but
there are extremely few such sites, and their prevalence among your friends and acquaintances is probably close to zero.

At the moment, let's leave aside thinking about whether or not to use big sites that earn
money from you and are ready to sell your data. Let's take it as a fact that you have to use them,
and let's set them up.

*The section will be updated*
