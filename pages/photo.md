# Photo

Unfortunately, photos (and any images in general) have long been easily recognized and indexed content.
Search engines can search for similar photos, distinguish text, objects, specific people on pictures. Social
networks can recognize you in an arbitrary photo and put a mark there with a link to you even without your knowledge.

Fortunately, in recent years, the trend towards privacy has intensified, and therefore social networks are introducing
reasonable restrictions on recognizing people. And search engines refuse to search for faces accurately at all. This reduces
the likelihood of malicious use of such functions, but does not prohibit the use of such technologies in general.
Now recognition tools can be easily created independently or you can use shareware analogues.

## How to check yourself

In the post-Soviet states, you surely can use [Yandex](https://images.yandex.ru/) for search by photo with your face.
If we talk about free specialized search engines, you can use [search4faces](https://search4faces.com/), which allows
you to search by photos from VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, TikTok, Clubhouse.

If you have actively used social networks, you can find not only your account, but also photos with your face
in the accounts of your friends, relatives or other people who are not even related to you. Of course,
it is extremely difficult to delete such photos, so if you don't want them to point at you, then you should
competently [delete account](./deleteme.md).
