# Photo

Unfortunately, photos (and any images in general) have long been easily recognized and indexed content.
Search engines can search for similar photos, distinguish text, objects, specific people on pictures. Social
networks can recognize you in an arbitrary photo and put a mark there with a link to you even without your knowledge.

Fortunately, in recent years, the trend towards privacy has intensified, and therefore social networks are introducing
reasonable restrictions on recognizing people. And search engines refuse to search for faces accurately at all. This reduces
the likelihood of malicious use of such functions, but does not prohibit the use of such technologies in general.
Now recognition tools can be easily created independently or you can use shareware analogues.
