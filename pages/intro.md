# Introduction

üö´ This guide is **not about anonymity**.

*Anonymity* is the complete concealment of information about you, down to your identity. It becomes impossible to understand who you are.
It is difficult to maintain anonymity on the Web, even for people from organized hacker groups and APTs.
You should start with *privacy* - hiding information about your personal life. Maintaining privacy is easier, it's like hygiene.

üö´ This guide is **not about resisting Big Brother and corporations**.

It is not my purpose to tell you how to become elusive and keep big companies from making money on you.
You are already in the system, you are already being used, you are already a commodity. But if you confidently consider yourself anonymous - you are probably in a different system, maybe even a criminal one, and you are unlikely to learn anything new here.

‚úÖ This guide is about **the value of personal information**.

Everyone is free to decide what to hide. I just want to show how the unhidden data is used, how to stop this usage, and how to understand how valuable the information you give to somebody entering symbols in the box and clicking the "Save" button. It's guide tell how not to sell your personal data for the price of a doner kebab.

‚úÖ This guide is about **privacy and Counter OSINT**.

You will learn about how people, who collect information about you, think. What do they use and are guided by, what
data is important to them. What can they do with this information and what they acually do.

Of course, you will receive instructions on how to reduce the risk of losing your privacy. Actually,
is a beginner's guide to the world of personal counterintelligence.

**Welcome!**

  On the guide pages, you will also see "ü•∑ Advanced level" sections.

  They describe protection against more serious threats, but also require more effort and expense.

  If you find these sections more useful to you, then you will surely be interested in a great guide to online anonymity
  ["The Hitchhiker's Guide to Online Anonymity"](https://whiteprime.github.io/thgtoa/).

  It is quite difficult to follow it (in the realities of Russia it is almost impossible), but it contains a lot of additional information, recommendations and references not knowingly included in this guide.
