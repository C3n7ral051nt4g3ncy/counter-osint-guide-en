# Introduction

üö´ This guide **is not about anonymity**.

* Anonymity* is a complete concealment of information about yourself, up to the identity. To make it impossible to understand who you are.
Maintaining anonymity on the Web is difficult even for people from organized hacker groups.
You should start with *privacy* - hiding information about your personal life. Maintaining privacy is easier, it's like hygiene.

üö´ This guide **is not about resisting big brother and corporations**.

I have no goal to tell you how to become elusive and not let big companies make money on themselves.
You are already in the system, you are already being used, you are already a product. And if you confidently object and consider yourself anonymous, you are probably in another system, maybe even a criminal one, and you are unlikely to learn anything new here.

‚úÖ This guide is **about the value of personal information**.

Everyone is free to decide for himself what to hide. I just want to show you how the data
that you have not hidden is used, and how to stop this use. How to understand how valuable is the information that you are going to enter into the window and click the "Save" button. How not to sell your personal data at the price of a shawarma.

‚úÖ This guide **is about privacy and counter-OSINT**.

You will learn about how people who collect information about you think. What they use and are guided by, what data is important to them. What they can do with this information (and do!).

And, of course, you will receive instructions on how to reduce the risks of losing your privacy to zero. In fact, it is a guide for newcomers to the world of personal counterintelligence.

**Welcome!**

  On the guide pages, you will also see "ü•∑ Advanced level" sections.

  They describe protection against more severe threats that require more effort and expense.

  If you find these sections more helpful, you'll probably be interested in the excellent guide to anonymity on the web
  ["The Hitchhiker's Guide to Online Anonymity"](https://whiteprime.github.io/thgtoa/).

 It is quite difficult to follow it (in the realities of Russia it is almost impossible), but it contains a lot of additional information, recommendations and links that are deliberately not included in this guide.
