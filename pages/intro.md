# Introduction

üö´ This guide is **not about anonymity**.

_Anonymity_ is the complete concealment of information about yourself, right down to your identity. So that it is impossible to know who you are. Maintaining online anonymity is difficult, even for people in organised hacker groups. _Privacy_ is an excellent place to start, which is hiding information about your personal life. Maintaining privacy is more manageable. It's like hygiene.

üö´ This guide is **not about resisting Big Brother and corporations**.

It is not my purpose to tell you how to become elusive and keep big companies from making money on you.
You are already in the system, and you are already being used, you are already a commodity. But if you confidently consider yourself anonymous - you are probably in a different system, maybe even a criminal one, and you are unlikely to learn anything new here.

‚úÖ This guide is about **the value of personal information**.

Everyone is free to decide what they want to hide. I just want to show you how the data you haven't hidden is used and how to stop it from being used. How to understand the value of the information you are about to enter in the box and click "Save". It's a guide on how not to sell your personal data for the price of a kebab.

‚úÖ This guide is about **privacy and Counter-OSINT**.

You will learn how people, who collect information about you, think. What they use and are guided by, and what data is essential to them. What they can do (and do!) with that information.

And, of course, you'll get instructions on reducing the risks of losing your privacy to zero. In fact, it's a beginner's guide to the world of personal counterintelligence.

**Welcome!**

  On the guide pages, you will also see "ü•∑ Advanced level" sections.

  They describe protection against more severe threats that require more effort and expense.

  If you find these sections more helpful, you'll probably be interested in the excellent guide to anonymity on the web
  ["The Hitchhiker's Guide to Online Anonymity"](https://whiteprime.github.io/thgtoa/).

  It is pretty difficult to follow (almost impossible in the realities of Russia). Still, it contains a lot of additional information, advice and links that are deliberately not included in this guide.
