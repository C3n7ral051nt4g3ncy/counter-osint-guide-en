# Last name, first name, patronymic, date of birth

Why is this information placed in a separate section? As a rule, the full name and date are enough to find a specific person,
since the probability of two people matching all these data is very low.

## Government agencies

There are regulations in various fields that oblige or encourage the publication of documents with personal data. On the one hand,
openness in these areas helps transparency in the industry (for example, public procurement, lists of past/graduates), but we are more concerned
that once we get into such a document, it will be difficult for us to leave it.

Russia includes the following:
- lists of applicants at universities: they are often laid out with full names, the number of points, from the year of the enrollment order, it can be concluded about the age;
- information about individual entrepreneurs, managers and founders of companies (USRLE/EGRIP);
- public files of court cases: once you have committed an offense and even managed to justify yourself, you can be found by the case history;
- public telephone databases: for the most part contain irrelevant information, but with reference to the house and apartment;
- public registers of debts and pledges;
- and so on.

## Login via another site (Single sign-on)

The modern architecture of authorization and registration in online services involves the active use of third-party "verified"
accounts. For example, almost everywhere in the foreign segment of the Internet there is an opportunity to log in via Facebook, while in Russia, VK login is increasingly
spreading. In some services, this is implied implicitly, for example, logging into YouTube through a Google account.

If you log in to a non-primary and public device in this way (for example, a TV or a game console), then there is a risk of disclosure
publicly displayed information about yourself, for example, first and last name. To minimize this risk, it is worth renaming the account from "First Name Last Name" to something neutral, for example, "Account".
