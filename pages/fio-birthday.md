# First, last, middle name, DOB

Why is this text placed in a separate section? It's usually enough to have a name and a date of birth to find a specific person,
since the probability of coincidence of all these data in two people is very low.

## Government agencies

Regulations in various fields oblige or encourage the publication of documents containing personal data. On the one hand, openness in these areas helps transparency in the industry (e.g. public procurement, lists of pass/fail graduates), but we are more concerned that once we are in such a document, it will be difficult to get out of it.

The following applies to Russia:
- lists of university applicants: often posted with full names, number of points, from the year of the enrolment order one can infer the age;
- information on individual entrepreneurs, company directors and founders (Unified State Register of Legal Entities/United State Register of Legal Entities or  ЕГРЮЛ/ЕГРИП));
- public files of court cases: once you have committed an offence and even if you manage to acquit yourself, you can be found through your case history;
- Public telephone databases: they contain mostly irrelevant information but are linked to the house and flat; 
- public registries of debts and liens;
- and so on.

## Login via another site (Single sign-on)

The modern architecture of authorisation and registration in online services involves using third-party "trusted" accounts. 
For example, almost everywhere in the foreign segment of the Internet there is an option to log in via Facebook, while in Russia, logging in via VK is becoming increasingly widespread. In some services, it is implicit, for example, logging in to YouTube via a Google account.

If you log in in this way on a non-mainstream and publicly accessible device (such as a TV or a game console), there is a risk of disclosing publicly displayed information about yourself, such as first and last names. To minimise this risk, it's a good idea to rename your account from "First Name Last Name" to something neutral, such as "Account".
