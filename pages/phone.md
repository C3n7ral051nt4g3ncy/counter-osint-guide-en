# Phone number

We said earlier that a telephone number is a **secondary** identifier.
From a common-sense point of view, it is: you can get rid of the phone, terminate the contract with the operator, or you can buy 100 numbers, and then the curious will go into analytical paralysis trying to make sense of it.

But in terms of online platforms, the phone is the most convenient means of contacting you and verifying your identity.
This is why *almost everyone* uses your number as a **primary**, unique identifier.

Hence the obvious conclusion. Almost any website knows your phone number and has information about you.
This information can (and is!) be exchanged with other companies - as part of a service, for money, or for bartering.

Examples of such sites and platforms:
- Public Wi-Fi authorisation systems (97-–§–ó);
- Discount and discount cards;
- Authorisation/verification in social networks and messengers.

By putting together all the pieces of information related to your phone number from different places, a threat actor can put together a portrait of yourself.
What to do with it?

## Keeping private life and work distinct

Most large companies offer their employees a company connection: either you get a new SIM card from the company, or they connect your number to a work rate.

But even if this is not an option, **always** get a separate phone number. I have several reasons for this:
- Your accounts will not be able to be linked by numbers automatically, except through a contract with the operator.
And that's a high level of protection!
- With a different phone number, it's much easier to think about privacy. You can choose which number to link to the texting bank and which one on the company's public website.
- Work is work. It should be separate from leisure and your private life. And a second phone will only do you good. :)

### One-time SMS reception services


Publicly available sites allow you to receive SMS from any sender. We will not list them because you can google them using the phrase 'receive SMS online'.

They use a few phone numbers at a time and often have accounts already set up on them on various sites: testers, spammers, scammers. However, they can be used for authorisation on public Wi-Fi networks. The only downside to this approach is that you need an active internet connection to use those services and access the public internet. üôÇ

Of course, such services are not recommended for obtaining sensitive information and linking to your accounts, as received messages and access codes can be seen by anyone.

And a tip: before attempting to use a number from any of these sites, pay attention to the time of the last SMS received (the table in the screenshot above). If that time is far from the past, the number is no longer working, but it has not yet been removed from the site.
