# Screen sharing

During the post-COVID, remote work became the norm. A lot of people call up with colleagues in specially designed
applications for this: Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and so on. One of the essential attributes of such applications is the function
of showing your screen: to show the interlocutor something, you make your desktop or individual windows visible, for example, the browser.

Of course, this carries with it the risks of disclosure of sensitive information. Let's leave aside the fact that you purposefully show something, consider only random consequences:

- Correspondence and messages in messengers and social networks (in pop-up windows)
- Open browser tabs or bookmarks
- Auto-completion hints in all input windows (especially in the browser address bar)

The latter category may carry the greatest risk: when you enter a symbol by symbol, the browser will try to offer you something from the history of a recent visit, search queries or bookmarks that has at least some overlap with the characters (even if they are similar letters anywhere).

To disable this behavior, you can uncheck all the boxes in the "Search" sections on Firefox / Search Suggestions" and "Privacy and Protection / Address panel".
