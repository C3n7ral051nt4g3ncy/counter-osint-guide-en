# Basic digital hygiene

Let's formulate our goal: to minimize the amount of data that can be collected about you in one place.

**Don't put eggs in one basket.**

Why is it important?

#### Example 1
You are using the services of a company that spends too little money on security.
At one point, they are **hacked**, and the entire customer base is in the hands of intruders: phones, postal addresses, names, surnames, your purchases.
Almost always, such databases end up in the public domain as a result. As a result, your data will be available to everyone.

#### Example 2
You use the company's services in a highly competitive business where the price of customer data is very high.
Some employees leave for competing companies, **copying** their customer base.
How this database will be used, and whether it will go further in the hands — there are no guarantees.

#### Example 3
You use the services of a company that collects the data of its customers to offer discounts and promotions.
To do this, they send out advertisements using the services of another company. This company does mailing lists all the time, and is interested in having its own customer data.
Therefore, the second company **accumulates** databases with the data of other customers, which can then be reused for other mailings.

Surely you have an objection: * is it really not controlled by the law in any way? They cannot legally use this data!*

Unfortunately, the legislation in the field of personal data processing (PD) does not keep up with the real state of affairs.
Exchange of virtual (not physical!) data is difficult to track and stop. 
Moreover, the market for illegal PD exchange is so developed that big players are lobbying for its legalization.
In such circumstances, we cannot rely on the protection of the state or the guarantees of companies, and we need to be more conscious to what data and in what quantity we give to others.
