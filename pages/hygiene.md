# Basic digital hygiene

Let's formulate our goal as follows: to minimize the amount of data that can be collected about you in one place.

**Don't put eggs in one basket.**

Why is it important?

#### Example 1
You use the services of a company that spends very little money on security. At one point, they get breached, and the entire customer database ends up in the hands of attackers, including your phone numbers, postal addresses, names, and purchases. Almost always, such databases will end up in the public domain. As a result, your data will be available to anyone interested.

#### Example 2
Let's take a look at the companies in a highly competitive business where the price of customer data is very high.
An employee may go to a competitor company and **have copied** the customer base. There are no guarantees on how this database will be used and whether it will go into the hands of others.

#### Example 3
You use the services of a company that collects its customers' data to offer discounts and promotions.
To do this, they send out advertisements using the services of another company. This company does the mailings and is interested in having its own customer data. 
Therefore, the second company **accumulates** databases of other people's customer data, which can then be reused for other mailings.

Surely you have an objection: *Is it really not controlled by the law in any way? They cannot legally use this data!*

Unfortunately, the legislation in the field of personal data in ex-USSR does not keep up with the realities.
Exchange of virtual (not physical!) data is difficult to track and stop.
Moreover, the market for illegal Personal Identifiable Information (PII) exchange is so developed that big players are lobbying for its legalization.
In such circumstances, we cannot rely on the protection of the state or the guarantees of companies, and we need
to be more conscious about what data and in what quantity we give to others.
