# Basic digital hygiene

Let's formulate our goal as follows: to minimize the amount of data that can be collected about you in one place.

**Don't put eggs in one basket.**

Why is it important?

#### Example 1
You are using the services of a company that spends too little money on security.
One day they get **hacked**, and the entire customer base come intruders: phones, postal addresses, names, surnames, your purchases.
Almost always, such databases appear in the public domain finally. As a result, your personal data will be available to everyone.

#### Example 2
Let's take a look at the companies in a highly competitive business where the price of customer data is very high.
Some employees leave for competing companies, **copying** their customer base.
How this database will be used? Whether it will be transfered to someone else? There are no guarantees.

#### Example 3
You used a service of a company that collects the data of its customers to offer discounts and promotions.
To do this, they send out advertisements using the services of another company. This company professionally make mailing lists
for all their clients, and the mailing company is interested in having its own big personal data database.
Therefore, the second company **accumulates** databases with the data of other customers, which can then be reused for other mailings.

Surely you have an objection: *is it really not controlled by the law in any way? They cannot legally use this data!*

Unfortunately, the legislation in the field of personal data in ex-USSR does not keep up with the realities.
Exchange of virtual (not physical!) data is difficult to track and stop.
Moreover, the market for illegal PII exchange is so developed that big players are lobbying for its legalization.
In such circumstances, we cannot rely on the protection of the state or the guarantees of companies, and we need
to be more conscious about what data and in what quantity we give to others.
